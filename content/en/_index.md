      Welcome to **Ding Lab**! It is affiliated to the [State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University](https://brain.bnu.edu.cn/). We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as the main research method, and focus on children and adults. Our research interests include children's language development, brain mechanisms of bilingual learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
